# Frontend SPA

This React project uses Vite and TailwindCSS.

## Setup

Install dependencies in this folder and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The API base URL is configured via the `VITE_API_URL` variable in `.env`. It
defaults to `http://localhost:3000` to match the backend running locally.
